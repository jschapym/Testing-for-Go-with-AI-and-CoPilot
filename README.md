# MSDS 431 Testing Go with Statistics: Using AI and Automated Code Generation

**Automated Code Generation**

Go has several libraries that can be instrumented to write certain portions of code, specifically unit tests. For example, one could demonstrate this using the Go Generate function where Go will automatically write a test based on a previously presented code sample. To accomplish this, a //go:generate directive must be added to the Go code itself before the Go Generate function is run for that code. This function can make processes more autmated and consisted, which is beneficial for production times while maintaining cleanliness of the code at hand.


**AI-Assisted Programming**

There are several programs that will assist with writing code in all languages. Specifically, Github Co-Pilot proves to be beneficial when generating code. This program completes and revises code in several programming languages. By installing this extension, one can simply ask the program to assist with code generation and it will give quick solutions and troubleshooting. It analyzes all code that has been already input and makes suggestions based off of that. This could prove to be helpful when starting out with Go.


**AI-Generated Code**

ChatGPT, or OpenAI, will generate code based on prompts given by the user. In the file "mainwithChatAI.go," the entirety of the code was generated based on a prompt I entered. I pasted the details of the assignment from week 3 and asked the AI to generate code for said assignment. I then had to ask for several revisions, which were promptly addressed. I then had the AI generate the testing and benchmark programs under "main_test.go." The code seemed to be efficient and was generated fiarly quickly, but was insufficient when discussing the assignment. If I were to prompt it more, it may have provided me with a more substantial program. However, overall, it seems to give fairly accurate depictions of what the assignment was asking for. 
The complete text document of my chat with ChatGPT is provided in a word document in this repository.

**Original Assignment**

The code for my original assignment can be found in the "Testing Assignment" folder.
